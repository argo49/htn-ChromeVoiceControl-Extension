# htn-ChromeVoiceControl-Extension

A [Hack the North](http://hackthenorth.com) project.

## a.k.a [SpeakUp](http://challengepost.com/software/speakup)

The SpeakUp Chrome extension allows you to open, close and switch to different tabs using your voice. You can also open customized groups of tabs through a group name.

#### Usage

While in a web page press `ctrl+shift+v` or `command+shift+v` if you're on a mac, then speak up!

**Note:** You might have to change chrome permissions to allow for SpeakUp to access your microphone.

#### List of Voice Commands
**Note:** Replace "example" with the desired website name (i.e. facebook or facebook.com are equally valid)

Open any website in a new tab:

`open example` or `open example.com`

Open customized group:

`open yourgroupname`

Switch to an existing tab:

`switch to example` or `switch to example.com`

Close current tab:

`close tab`

Close another tab in the window:

`close example` or `close example.com`

#### Creating Custom Tab Groups

I) Navigate to Tools > Extensions

II) Find SpeakUp extension and Click on 'Options'

III) Enter the group name (i.e. school)

IV) Enter a website url in the text field

V) Create more custom groups if desired

#### Example

I usually use my dropbox and google drive when I study, so I`ve created a SpeakUp group called "school" with links to drive.google.com and dropbox.com. Now whenever I want to open these tabs, all I have to do is hit ctrl+shift+v say

press `ctrl+shift+v`

`open school`

press `ctrl+shift+v`

#### Etc

We initially wanted to make an extension for the visually impaired to be combined with a screen reader like chrome vox. We soon realized that controlling the browser with your voice could be cool for anyone though and so we created SpeakUp, a productivity tool to help you navigate your tabs more naturally than ever before possible.
